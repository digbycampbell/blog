Bitcoin is still a new technology, and only a small number of people know about it or use it. Many people are skeptical and don’t think it has value.

What bitcoin is “worth” is determined by demand, similar to how gold has had value for thousands of years and until today.

Because there will only ever be a fixed number of bitcoin, as adoption of the bitcoin network increases there will be less bitcoin to satisfy demand, and the price will rise.
