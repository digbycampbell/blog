Bitcoin transactions are broadcast by participants across the network, and organised into blocks, which take place approximately every 10 minutes.

Blocks have a fixed maximum size, and senders of transactions 'bid' for the right to have their transaction allocated to a block.

When there is low demand for block space, transaction costs fall to the minimum (1sat/vbyte) and a basic transaction costs about 4 cents. When there is high demand to transact on the network, transaction costs rise as users outbid one another in a competition for block space.

Bitcoin developers and businesses are innovating new methods and techniques on the bitcoin network to reduce transaction costs, such as the Lightning Network.
