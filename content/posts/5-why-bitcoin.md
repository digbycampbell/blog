If you are reading this, you probably live in a developed country whose financial system was designed in the 20th century, and has been relatively unchanged throughout your lifetime. Banks, financial institutions and governments in your country (in your lifetime) have always provided access to financial technology such as cheques, insurance, savings accounts, mortgages, credit checks, credit cards and debit cards.

This is not the case for as many as 2.5 billion people worldwide, who are unbanked. Without financial technology, individuals have less ability to save, less access to capital, and fewer options when making investments.

The bitcoin network is open and accessible to all, and unbanked individuals can freely participate and make use of financial technology for the first time.
