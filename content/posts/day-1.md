**Command line** is a way to control files, folders and applications on your computer by using text commands instead of using a mouse.

Command line feels a little bit like writing a piece of legislation about something simple - it seems clunky to have to describe in words, but its very precise.

I've used command line before so I didn't have any issue doing this section quickly - I used:  
  ls    - list folder contents  
  cd    - change directory  
  ~     - return to home directory  
  cat   - print out a file contents  
  less  - file viewer  
  touch - create new file

  **Version Control with Git** explained what the functions of git are. Github is to git, what dropbox is to windows explorer - with loads of social/collaborative features built into an easy browser interface

  From my previous experience with git and github, I've learned the difference - but its always a bit rusty to use it again (from the command line) when I haven't used it in a while. Good practice!
