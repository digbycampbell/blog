**Command line** is a way to control files, folders and applications on your computer by using text commands instead of using a mouse.

Using command line feels like writing legislation about something simple like driving a car - it feels clunky, but it can be very precise.

I've used command line before so I didn't have any issue doing this section quickly - I used:  
  ls    - list folder contents  
  cd    - change directory  
  ~     - return to home directory  
  cat   - print out a file contents  
  less  - file viewer  
  touch - create new file

  **Version Control with Git** explained what the functions of git are. Github is to git, as Dropbox is to your local hard drive - with loads of social/collaborative features built into an easy browser interface

  From my previous experience with git and github, I've learned the difference - but its always a bit rusty to use it again (from the command line) when I haven't used it in a while. Good practice!


**Install and Explore Git** was a useful course which tightened up some of my pre-existing knowledge of git and added some new stuff which would be much more useful in larger projects (git show, git log)

A git workflow would generally go something like:  
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Funny comment here"
  ???
  git remote add
  git push

Overall this went quite smoothly - I was familiar with the content in advance and still enjoyed the material
