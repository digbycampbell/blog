If you try to pay for something using bitcoin the merchant may or may not accept it, as is their choice.

The more people willing to accept bitcoin for goods and services, the more likely you will be able to spend it.

There are some third-party services designed to make it easier to make payments in bitcoin, like Shopify integrations.

Eventually, when many people own bitcoin and would like to earn more bitcoin, it will be normal to buy things with bitcoin.
