The bitcoin software connects the thousands or millions of computers of people who choose to participate and monitors and enables transactions between participants on the network.

The software distributes (a maximum of) 21 million bitcoin, which participants of the network can use to transact with one another. Each bitcoin is divisible, to be more practical to use.

The special innovation of the bitcoin software means that participants can transact using the network without needing to trust one another, or without the help of a trusted third party.

Bitcoin transactions and the bitcoin network is independent from existing financial and banking systems, and it is possible to use bitcoin anywhere in the world you might have access to the internet.

All other narratives surrounding the values and value of bitcoin are downstream of these basic features of the software.
