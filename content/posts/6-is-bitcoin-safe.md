Dishonest actors on the bitcoin network could try to rewrite the ledger so that they have more bitcoin.

The bitcoin software relies on cryptography to protect the ledger. The designer of bitcoin chose trusted cryptography techniques, and combined them in a creative way to build a security system.

One of the main principles implemented is Proof of Work, a system which forces members of the network to spend computing power to compete for the right to write transactions to the ledger.

More cryptography makes it very easy for other participants on the network to verify that transactions are legitimate.

Because it costs a lot to write transactions, but it is cheap to verify (or reject) transactions, it is not economic to try to cheat.
