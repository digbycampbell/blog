Command line is a way to control files, folders and applications on your computer by using text commands instead of using a mouse.

Command line feels a little bit like writing a piece of legislation about something simple - it seems clunky to have to describe in words, but its very precise.

I've used command line before so I didn't have any issue doing this section quickly - I used:
  ls    - list folder contents
  cd    - change directory
  ~     - return to home directory
  cat   - print out a file contents
  less  - file viewer
  touch - create new file
