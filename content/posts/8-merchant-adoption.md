There are challenges for merchants who would like to accept bitcoin as payment. Sales taxes and income tax must be paid in local currency, and some governments impose specific taxes on bitcoin transactions.

The bitcoin network makes no allowance for government accounting requirements, so it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure they are compliant.

Bitcoin developers and businesses are designing systems and services which make it easier for sellers to accept bitcoin, converting received coins directly into currency and keeping accounting records.
