Learning to **Branch, Pull, Merge**  demonstrated interesting git features, which I imagine are useful for working in a team or an organisation.

The main or master branch is like the 'stable' version of your code. It should be the most up to date 'working' version of your code. When you want to work on a new idea, or make bug fixes or changes that you aren't yet sure about - you should create a seperate branch to work on until they're ready to be merged into the code later on.

These concepts make intuitive sense to me - having worked on group projects in the past: keeping track of multiple different workstreams with multiple team members at the same time is a nightmare at best, and can result in loss of work at worst.
