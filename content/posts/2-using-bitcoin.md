Humans' desire to transact and trade with one another facilitated the emergence of money, a technology with a long history of development. Bitcoin is the latest of these technological developments.

Bitcoin can be used like money, because it keeps a secure ledger of all transactions between participants on the bitcoin network, like dollars in a bank account.

When Andreas and Barry would like to conduct a transaction on the bitcoin network, Andreas sends bitcoin he controls to Barry's address, and the transaction is denominated in bitcoin units (BTC).

Like cents are to dollars, the lowest denomination of bitcoin is 1 sat, or 100 millionth of 1 bitcoin.
