The lightning network is software which makes use of bitcoin to facilitate transactions.

The lightning network is enabled by the bitcoin network much like modern websites might make use of a tech stack like Amazon Web Services, or like an internet connection makes use of a copper phone line.

Participants on the lightning network connect to peers and form ‘payment channels’ between them. Information about payment channels is shared amongst nodes on the network to allow visibility of the network as a mesh.

Sats are transported across the strands of the mesh, allowing transactions between peers on the network even without a direct payment channel between transacting parties.
