<p>This pseudonym was used from then on and is credited as the author of the bitcoin white paper, and the first release of the bitcoin software.</p>
<p>Satoshi continued to interact with other developers and the bitcoin community until 2010 when his pseudonym ceased to be active online in the community, and he handed over control of the bitcoin software and website. The estimated 1 million coins which are attributed to Satoshi - which have increased in dollar value by about 100,000,000% - have not moved since that time. The value of those coins today makes Satoshi one of the richest individuals in the world.</p>
<p>In the time since Satoshi disappeared, bitcoin has exploded in popularity - and people have tried to discover the identity of Satoshi. For now, his real-world identity and details about him remain unconfirmed, and his pseudonymity is maintained.</p>
