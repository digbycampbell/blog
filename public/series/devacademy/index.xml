      <description>Command line is a way to control files, folders and applications on your computer by using text commands instead of using a mouse.
Using command line feels like writing legislation about something simple like driving a car - it feels clunky, but it can be very precise.

      <description>Learning to Branch, Pull, Merge demonstrated interesting git features, which I imagine are useful for working in a team or an organisation.
The main or master branch is like the &amp;lsquo;stable&amp;rsquo; version of your code. It should be the most up to date &amp;lsquo;working&amp;rsquo; version of your code. When you want to work on a new idea, or make bug fixes or changes that you aren&amp;rsquo;t yet sure about - you should create a seperate branch to work on until they&amp;rsquo;re ready to be merged into the code later on.</description>
