<p>Bitcoin was designed to be used as money, but a bitcoin transaction and the bitcoin network is independent from existing money and  our financial and banking systems.</p>
<p>When Andreas and Barry would like to conduct a transaction on the Bitcoin network, Andreas sends bitcoin from his address to Barry&rsquo;s address, and the transaction is denominated in bitcoin units (BTC).</p>
<p>What bitcoin is &ldquo;worth&rdquo; is determined by individuals, groups &amp; society based on speculative demand (using bitcoin to store value into the future) and utility demand (using bitcoin to make a transaction on the network). This is similar to how gold has and has had value for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Because bitcoin is independent of existing monetary and financial networks, it is possible to use bitcoin anywhere in the world with internet. When you see the &ldquo;price&rdquo; of bitcoin, that&rsquo;s the most up to date estimate that someone, somewhere in the world, is willing to pay for your bitcoin.</p>
